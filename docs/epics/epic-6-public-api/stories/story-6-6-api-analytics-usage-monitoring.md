### Request Tracking

```typescript
// Request analytics middleware
const requestAnalytics = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const startTime = Date.now()
  
  // Capture request metadata
  const requestData = {
    timestamp: new Date(),
    method: req.method,
    endpoint: req.route?.path,
    apiKey: req.apiKey?.id,
    userId: req.user?.id,
    userAgent: req.get('User-Agent'),
    ip: req.ip,
    country: req.geoip?.country,
    referrer: req.get('Referer')
  }
  
  // Capture response metadata
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime
    
    const responseData = {
      ...requestData,
      statusCode: res.statusCode,
      responseTime,
      contentLength: res.get('Content-Length'),
      cached: res.get('X-Cache-Status') === 'HIT'
    }
    
    // Send to analytics pipeline
    analyticsQueue.add('api-request', responseData)
  })
  
  next()
}
```

### Performance Metrics Collection

```typescript
// Performance metrics collector
class PerformanceCollector {
  private metrics: Map<string, MetricCollector> = new Map()
  
  recordResponseTime(endpoint: string, time: number) {
    const metric = this.getOrCreateMetric(endpoint, 'response_time')
    metric.record(time)
  }
  
  recordDatabaseQuery(query: string, time: number) {
    const metric = this.getOrCreateMetric(query, 'db_query_time')
    metric.record(time)
  }
  
  recordCacheHit(key: string, hit: boolean) {
    const metric = this.getOrCreateMetric(key, 'cache_hit_rate')
    metric.increment(hit ? 'hit' : 'miss')
  }
  
  recordError(endpoint: string, error: Error) {
    const metric = this.getOrCreateMetric(endpoint, 'error_rate')
    metric.increment(error.constructor.name)
  }
  
  generateReport(): PerformanceReport {
    return {
      responseTime: this.aggregateResponseTimes(),
      databasePerformance: this.aggregateDatabaseMetrics(),
      cachePerformance: this.aggregateCacheMetrics(),
      errorRates: this.aggregateErrorRates()
    }
  }
}
```

## Real-time Analytics Pipeline

### Event Streaming

```typescript
// Real-time analytics event processor
import { KafkaConsumer } from 'kafkajs'

const analyticsConsumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'api-analytics' })

await analyticsConsumer.subscribe({ topic: 'api-events' })

await analyticsConsumer.run({
  eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
    const event = JSON.parse(message.value.toString())
    
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'API_REQUEST':
        await processApiRequest(event.data)
        break
      case 'DEVELOPER_REGISTRATION':
        await processDeveloperRegistration(event.data)
        break
      case 'SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGE':
        await processSubscriptionChange(event.data)
        break
      case 'ERROR_OCCURRED':
        await processError(event.data)
        break
    }
  }
})
```

### Data Aggregation

```typescript
// Time-series data aggregation
class TimeSeriesAggregator {
  async aggregateUsageMetrics(timeRange: TimeRange, granularity: string) {
    const pipeline = [
      {
        $match: {
          timestamp: {
            $gte: timeRange.start,
            $lte: timeRange.end
          }
        }
      },
      {
        $group: {
          _id: {
            $dateToString: {
              format: this.getDateFormat(granularity),
              date: '$timestamp'
            }
          },
          requestCount: { $sum: 1 },
          uniqueUsers: { $addToSet: '$userId' },
          averageResponseTime: { $avg: '$responseTime' },
          errorCount: { $sum: { $cond: [{ $gte: ['$statusCode', 400] }, 1, 0] } }
        }
      },
      {
        $sort: { _id: 1 }
      }
    ]
    
    return await AnalyticsEvent.aggregate(pipeline)
  }
  
  private getDateFormat(granularity: string): string {
    switch (granularity) {
      case 'hour': return '%Y-%m-%d %H:00:00'
      case 'day': return '%Y-%m-%d'
      case 'week': return '%Y-W%U'
      case 'month': return '%Y-%m'
      default: return '%Y-%m-%d'
    }
  }
}
