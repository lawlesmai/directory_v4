# Story 5.10: Payment Security & Compliance

**Epic:** Epic 5 - Sales & Payment Funnel  
**Story ID:** 5.10  
**Title:** Payment Security & Compliance  
**Description:** Implement comprehensive security measures and compliance protocols that protect sensitive payment data, ensure PCI DSS Level 1 compliance, and maintain the highest security standards for payment processing.

## User Story

**As a** platform handling sensitive payment data  
**I want** comprehensive security measures and compliance protocols  
**So that** customer payment information is protected and regulatory requirements are met while maintaining customer trust and avoiding security breaches

## Business Value

- **Primary Value:** Protect business from security breaches and regulatory penalties
- **Trust & Reputation:** Maintain customer confidence through demonstrable security
- **Compliance Protection:** Avoid fines, penalties, and loss of payment processing capabilities
- **Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive security reduces business and financial risk

## Acceptance Criteria

### PCI DSS Compliance Implementation

**Given** payment card data processing requirements  
**When** implementing payment security  
**Then** achieve and maintain PCI DSS Level 1 compliance:

#### Data Security Standards
- [ ] No storage of sensitive authentication data (CVV, PIN, magnetic stripe data)
- [ ] Tokenization of all payment methods through Stripe with no raw card data handling
- [ ] Encryption of payment data in transit using TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- [ ] Secure key management and automated rotation procedures
- [ ] Comprehensive access logging and monitoring for all payment data access
- [ ] Regular security assessments and annual penetration testing
- [ ] Documented incident response procedures for payment data breaches

#### Network Security
- [ ] Firewall configuration protecting all payment processing systems
- [ ] Network segmentation isolating payment processing from other systems
- [ ] Secure wireless network configuration with WPA3 encryption (if applicable)
- [ ] Regular vulnerability scanning and immediate remediation
- [ ] Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- [ ] Secure remote access procedures for system maintenance
- [ ] Comprehensive network monitoring and anomaly detection

### Payment Fraud Prevention

**Given** fraud risks in payment processing  
**When** implementing fraud prevention  
**Then** establish comprehensive fraud protection:

#### Fraud Detection Systems

- [ ] Blacklist management for known fraudulent entities and patterns
- [ ] Integration with third-party fraud prevention services (Radar, Kount)

#### Risk Management
- [ ] Dynamic risk scoring for all payment transactions
- [ ] Step-up authentication for high-risk payments (3D Secure, SMS verification)
- [ ] Payment amount limits based on comprehensive risk assessment
- [ ] Customer verification procedures for suspicious activity patterns
- [ ] Chargeback prevention and comprehensive management system
- [ ] Dispute resolution process with evidence collection and submission
- [ ] Real-time fraud alert notification system for immediate response

### Security Monitoring & Incident Response

**Given** ongoing security threats to payment systems  
**When** monitoring payment security  
**Then** implement comprehensive security monitoring:

#### Real-Time Security Monitoring
- [ ] Payment system intrusion detection with immediate alerting
- [ ] Anomalous payment pattern identification and automatic blocking
- [ ] Failed payment authentication monitoring and threshold alerting
- [ ] Suspicious customer behavior detection and investigation workflows
- [ ] Payment data access monitoring with comprehensive audit trails
- [ ] Security event correlation and automated threat analysis
- [ ] Automated threat response for known attack patterns and signatures

#### Incident Response Procedures
- [ ] Payment security incident classification and severity assessment
- [ ] Immediate response procedures for suspected data breaches
- [ ] Customer notification requirements and templates for security incidents
- [ ] Law enforcement coordination procedures for fraud cases
- [ ] Forensic investigation procedures and evidence preservation
- [ ] Post-incident analysis and security improvement processes
- [ ] Regulatory notification requirements compliance (state and federal)

### Compliance Auditing & Documentation

**Given** regulatory audit requirements  
**When** maintaining compliance documentation  
**Then** ensure comprehensive audit readiness:

#### Compliance Documentation
- [ ] PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ-D) completion and maintenance
- [ ] Annual security assessments and qualified security assessor (QSA) validation
- [ ] Comprehensive compliance evidence collection and organized maintenance
- [ ] Detailed policy and procedure documentation for all security controls
- [ ] Staff training records and security awareness certification tracking
