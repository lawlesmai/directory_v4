interface RetryStrategy {
  failure_reason: string
  retry_schedule: number[] // Days after failure
  max_attempts: number
  payment_methods: string[]
}

export class PaymentRetryEngine {
  private retryStrategies: Map<string, RetryStrategy> = new Map([
    ['insufficient_funds', {
      failure_reason: 'insufficient_funds',
      retry_schedule: [3, 7], // Wait longer for funds
      max_attempts: 2,
      payment_methods: ['card', 'ach']
    }],
    ['card_declined', {
      failure_reason: 'card_declined',
      retry_schedule: [1, 3, 7],
      max_attempts: 3,
      payment_methods: ['card', 'alternative']
    }],
    ['expired_card', {
      failure_reason: 'expired_card',
      retry_schedule: [1], // Quick retry after update prompt
      max_attempts: 1,
      payment_methods: ['card_update_required']
    }]
  ])

  async processFailedPayment(paymentIntent: FailedPaymentIntent) {
    const strategy = this.retryStrategies.get(paymentIntent.failure_reason)
    if (!strategy) return

    // Schedule retry attempts
    for (const days of strategy.retry_schedule) {
      await this.scheduleRetry(paymentIntent, days)
    }

    // Initialize dunning sequence
    await this.initializeDunningSequence(paymentIntent)

    // Update customer notification
    await this.notifyCustomer(paymentIntent, 'payment_failed')
  }

  private async scheduleRetry(paymentIntent: FailedPaymentIntent, days: number) {
    const retryDate = new Date()
    retryDate.setDate(retryDate.getDate() + days)
