Final version incorporating the six-phase, TDD-oriented development plan.
John, Product Manager


1. Goals and Background Context

(As defined in our session)

2. Requirements

(The final, fully refined list of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements, including NFR5 for performance and the final MVP scoping for subscription tiers, admin functions, and search capabilities, is documented for the development team.)

3. User Interface Design Goals

(The final, detailed UI goals, incorporating the "modern and edgy but trustworthy" aesthetic, specific interaction paradigms, and the 'trust-building' component, are documented for the design team.)

4. Technical Assumptions

(The final technical assumptions, including the expanded rationale for the Monorepo, Serverless (Supabase), and Next.js/Vercel stack, are documented for the Architect.)

5. Final Development Plan (Epics)


Phase 1 / Epic 1: The Public Directory MVP

Goal: To launch a live, functional, and searchable public directory populated with database-driven test data. This delivers a valuable, view-only product for end-users.
Key Outcomes: A live, public website that search engines can begin to index.

Phase 2 / Epic 2: Authentication & Authorization Layer

Goal: To build and integrate a complete, secure authentication and authorization system on top of the foundational site.
Key Outcomes: A fully functional login, signup, and password recovery system using Supabase Auth.

Phase 3 / Epic 3: The Full-Featured Business Portal

Goal: To build the complete, secure business admin portal for authenticated users, with all features for all subscription tiers enabled.
Key Outcomes: Logged-in business owners can manage their profiles, photos, and see placeholders for future features.

Phase 4 / Epic 4: The Platform Admin Portal

Goal: To build your secure "super-admin" portal for authenticated administrators.
Key Outcomes: Your own secure admin portal with the ability to manage site settings, view customer data, and use the user impersonation feature.

Phase 5 / Epic 5: The Sales & Payment Funnel

Goal: To build the complete, fully functional sales and monetization engine, integrating with the existing authentication system.
Key Outcomes: Authenticated users can select a plan from a sales page and successfully subscribe via a seamless Stripe integration.

Phase 6 / Epic 6: The Public API

Goal: To build, test, and document an outbound, public-facing API that is secured by the authentication layer.
Key Outcomes: Authenticated business users (on the appropriate tier) can generate API keys and access directory data programmatically.

6. Overarching Development Principles

TDD is Mandatory: The entire build will be Test-Driven.
Persistent Development Session: Once authentication is built, development of subsequent features should be done in a persistent logged-in state.
Comprehensive Testing: Every feature will have both frontend and backend tests.
No Dead Ends: Every link and button must lead to a real, styled page.
Polished UI: The presentation must be clean, professional, and smooth.
Agent-Friendly Stories: All epics will be broken down into small, digestible stories.
(Note: The detailed story-by-story breakdown for each epic is omitted in this high-level export but is fully documented for the Story Manager agent.)
