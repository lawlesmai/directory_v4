### Database Schema for Payment Management

**Given** comprehensive payment tracking requirements  
**When** designing payment data structures  
**Then** implement robust payment schemas:

```sql
-- Customer payment profiles
CREATE TABLE stripe_customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) UNIQUE,
  stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  default_payment_method VARCHAR(255),
  tax_id VARCHAR(255),
  billing_address JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Subscription management
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES stripe_customers(id),
  business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id),
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  plan_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  current_period_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  current_period_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  trial_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  cancel_at_period_end BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  canceled_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Payment transaction history
CREATE TABLE payment_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  stripe_payment_intent_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES stripe_customers(id),
  subscription_id UUID REFERENCES subscriptions(id),
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL, -- in cents
  currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'USD',
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  payment_method_id VARCHAR(255),
  failure_code VARCHAR(100),
  failure_message TEXT,
  receipt_url VARCHAR(500),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Invoice management
CREATE TABLE invoices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  stripe_invoice_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES stripe_customers(id),
  subscription_id UUID REFERENCES subscriptions(id),
  amount_paid INTEGER,
  amount_due INTEGER,
  currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'USD',
  status VARCHAR(50),
  invoice_pdf VARCHAR(500),
  due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  paid_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Webhook Event Processing

**Given** real-time payment event notifications from Stripe  
**When** processing webhook events  
**Then** implement comprehensive event handling:

#### Critical Webhook Events
- [ ] `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription setup
- [ ] `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription changes
- [ ] `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription cancellation
- [ ] `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Successful payment processing
- [ ] `invoice.payment_failed` - Failed payment handling
- [ ] `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` - Trial expiration warnings
- [ ] `payment_method.attached` - Payment method updates

### Security & Compliance Implementation

**Given** PCI DSS and security requirements  
**When** implementing payment security  
**Then** ensure comprehensive security measures:

- [ ] No card data storage on platform servers
- [ ] Stripe Elements for secure payment form handling
- [ ] Webhook signature verification for all events
- [ ] Environment-specific API key management
