## Automated Testing Implementation

### Unit Test Example
```typescript
describe('ReviewCard Component', () => {
  it('should display review with correct sentiment indicator', async () => {
    const mockReview = {
      id: 'review-1',
      rating: 5,
      content: 'Excellent service!',
      sentimentAnalysis: { score: 0.8, label: 'positive' }
    };
    
    render(<ReviewCard review={mockReview} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Excellent service!')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByTestId('sentiment-positive')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Integration Test Example
```typescript
describe('Review Response System', () => {
  it('should submit response and update review status', async () => {
    const reviewId = 'test-review-1';
    const responseText = 'Thank you for your feedback!';
    
    await reviewService.submitResponse(reviewId, responseText);
    
    const updatedReview = await reviewService.getReview(reviewId);
    expect(updatedReview.response).toBe(responseText);
    expect(updatedReview.status).toBe('responded');
  });
});
```

### E2E Test Example
```typescript
test('Complete review management workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/dashboard/reviews');
  
  // Verify review list loads
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="review-card"]')).toHaveCount(5);
  
  // Respond to first review
  await page.click('[data-testid="respond-button"]:first-of-type');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="response-editor"]', 'Thank you for your review!');
  await page.click('[data-testid="submit-response"]');
  
  // Verify response was submitted
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="response-submitted"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```
