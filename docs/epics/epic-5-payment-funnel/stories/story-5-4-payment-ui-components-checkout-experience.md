  return (
    <Elements
      stripe={stripePromise}
      options={{
        appearance: {
          theme: 'night',
          variables: {
            colorPrimary: '#0A9396', // teal-primary

  currency,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
  customerDetails
}) => {
  const stripe = useStripe()
  const elements = useElements()
  const [isProcessing, setIsProcessing] = useState(false)
  const [paymentError, setPaymentError] = useState<string | null>(null)

  const processPayment = async (billingDetails: BillingDetails) => {
    if (!stripe || !elements) return

    setIsProcessing(true)
    setPaymentError(null)

    try {
      const { clientSecret } = await paymentsApi.createPaymentIntent({
        amount,
        currency,
        customer_details: billingDetails
      })

      const { error, paymentIntent } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(
        clientSecret,
        {
          payment_method: {
            card: elements.getElement(CardElement)!,
            billing_details: billingDetails
          }
        }
      )

      if (error) {
        handlePaymentError(error)
      } else if (paymentIntent) {
        onSuccess(paymentIntent)
        analytics.track('Payment Success', { amount, currency })
      }
    } catch (error) {
      handlePaymentError(error as StripeError)
    } finally {
      setIsProcessing(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <GlassMorphism variant="premium" className="p-8 space-y-6">
      {/* Payment amount display */}
      <PaymentSummary amount={amount} currency={currency} />
      
      {/* Billing information form */}
      <BillingDetailsForm onSubmit={processPayment} />

        amount={amount} 
        currency={currency} 
      />
    </GlassMorphism>
  )
}
```

#### Payment Method Manager

  const { data: paymentMethods, refetch } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['payment-methods'],
    queryFn: paymentsApi.getPaymentMethods
  })

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-heading font-semibold text-cream">
          Payment Methods
        </h3>
        <Button
          onClick={() => setShowAddMethod(true)}
          className="bg-teal-primary hover:bg-teal-secondary"
        >
          Add Payment Method
        </Button>
      </div>

      {paymentMethods?.map((method) => (
        <PaymentMethodCard
          key={method.id}
          paymentMethod={method}
          onSetDefault={() => setDefaultMethod(method.id)}
