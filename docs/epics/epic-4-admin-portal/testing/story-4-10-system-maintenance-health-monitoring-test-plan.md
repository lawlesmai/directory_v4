# Story 4.10: System Maintenance & Health Monitoring - Test Plan

## Objective
Validate comprehensive system health monitoring, maintenance workflow management, uptime monitoring systems, and automated system maintenance capabilities.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. System Health Monitoring
- [ ] Test real-time server performance monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Verify database health and performance tracking
- [ ] Check application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Test network connectivity and latency monitoring
- [ ] Validate third-party service health integration
- [ ] Test system resource utilization alerting
- [ ] Verify performance trend analysis and forecasting
- [ ] Check system capacity planning and scaling alerts

### 2. Uptime & Availability Monitoring
- [ ] Test website and application uptime monitoring
- [ ] Verify SLA monitoring and compliance tracking
- [ ] Check downtime detection and alerting systems
- [ ] Test failover and disaster recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Validate load balancing and traffic distribution
- [ ] Test backup system monitoring and validation
- [ ] Verify geographic availability monitoring
- [ ] Check service dependency monitoring

### 3. Automated Maintenance Workflows
- [ ] Test scheduled maintenance planning and execution
- [ ] Verify automated backup scheduling and validation
- [ ] Check system update and patch management
- [ ] Test database maintenance and optimization
- [ ] Validate log rotation and cleanup automation
- [ ] Test cache clearing and optimization routines
- [ ] Verify security scan scheduling and reporting
- [ ] Check automated health check routines

## Success Criteria
