    lastModified: new Date(),
    changeFrequency: 'daily', 
    priority: 0.8
  }))
  
  return [...businessUrls, ...categoryUrls]
}

// Meta tag generation for business pages
export function generateBusinessMetadata(business: Business) {
  const title = `${business.name} - ${business.category} in ${business.city}, ${business.state}`
  const description = `${business.description.slice(0, 150)}... Located in ${business.city}, ${business.state}. Contact: ${business.phone}`
  
  return {
    title,
    description,
    keywords: [business.category, business.city, business.state, ...business.tags],
