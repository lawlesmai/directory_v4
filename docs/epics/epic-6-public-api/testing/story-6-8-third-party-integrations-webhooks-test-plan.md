- [ ] Verify webhook event payload generation and formatting
- [ ] Check webhook delivery reliability and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Test webhook security with signature validation
- [ ] Validate webhook delivery order and event sequencing
- [ ] Test webhook filtering and event subscription management
- [ ] Verify webhook delivery status tracking and monitoring
- [ ] Check webhook endpoint validation and health checks

### 2. Third-party Platform Integrations
- [ ] Test CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- [ ] Verify marketing platform integration (Mailchimp, Constant Contact)
- [ ] Check social media platform integration (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)
- [ ] Test mapping service integration (Google Maps, Mapbox)
