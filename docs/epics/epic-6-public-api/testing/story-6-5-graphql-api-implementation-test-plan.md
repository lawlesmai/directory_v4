# Story 6.5: GraphQL API Implementation - Test Plan

## Objective
Validate comprehensive GraphQL API functionality, schema design, resolver performance, query optimization, and type safety implementation.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. GraphQL Schema Design & Validation
- [ ] Test GraphQL schema definition and structure
- [ ] Verify type safety and schema validation
- [ ] Check GraphQL field resolution and nested queries
- [ ] Test GraphQL mutations and data modifications
- [ ] Validate GraphQL subscriptions and real-time updates
- [ ] Test GraphQL input validation and error handling
- [ ] Verify GraphQL schema evolution and versioning
- [ ] Check GraphQL introspection and self-documentation

### 2. Query Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Test GraphQL query complexity analysis and limits
- [ ] Verify query batching and request optimization
- [ ] Check GraphQL resolver performance and caching
- [ ] Test N+1 query problem prevention and resolution
- [ ] Validate GraphQL query depth limiting and protection
- [ ] Test GraphQL query cost analysis and budgeting
- [ ] Verify GraphQL response compression and optimization
- [ ] Check GraphQL query execution time monitoring

### 3. GraphQL Security & Authorization
- [ ] Test GraphQL authentication integration and token validation
- [ ] Verify field-level authorization and access controls
- [ ] Check GraphQL rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Test GraphQL injection attack prevention
- [ ] Validate GraphQL query whitelisting and approval
- [ ] Test GraphQL schema security and information disclosure
- [ ] Verify GraphQL audit logging and monitoring
- [ ] Check GraphQL CORS configuration and security headers

### 4. GraphQL Developer Experience
- [ ] Test GraphQL playground and interactive documentation
- [ ] Verify GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language) clarity
- [ ] Check GraphQL error messages and debugging information
- [ ] Test GraphQL tooling integration and IDE support
- [ ] Validate GraphQL client library compatibility
- [ ] Test GraphQL subscription implementation and WebSocket handling
- [ ] Verify GraphQL caching strategies and implementation
- [ ] Check GraphQL federation and schema stitching (if applicable)

## Success Criteria
- <500ms average GraphQL query response time
- 100% type safety and schema validation
- Complete GraphQL security and authorization implementation
- >95% developer satisfaction with GraphQL API experience
- Successful prevention of common GraphQL vulnerabilities
- Optimized resolver performance with minimal N+1 queries
