# Story 6.10: API Security & Compliance - Test Plan

## Objective
Validate comprehensive API security measures, compliance framework implementation, threat protection systems, and security monitoring capabilities.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. API Security Infrastructure
- [ ] Test API endpoint security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Verify HTTPS enforcement and SSL/TLS certificate validation
- [ ] Check API request/response encryption and data protection
- [ ] Test API input validation and sanitization against injection attacks
- [ ] Validate API authentication token security and JWT validation
- [ ] Test API authorization controls and permission enforcement
- [ ] Verify API security headers implementation (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Check API DDoS protection and mitigation systems

### 2. API Threat Detection & Prevention
- [ ] Test API abuse detection and automated blocking
- [ ] Verify API bot detection and CAPTCHA integration
- [ ] Check API anomaly detection and behavioral analysis
- [ ] Test API brute force attack prevention and rate limiting
- [ ] Validate API SQL injection and XSS protection
- [ ] Test API CSRF protection and token validation
- [ ] Verify API data exfiltration prevention and monitoring
- [ ] Check API supply chain security and dependency scanning

### 3. API Compliance & Standards
- [ ] Test OWASP API Security Top 10 compliance
- [ ] Verify GDPR compliance for API data handling
- [ ] Check PCI DSS compliance for payment-related APIs
- [ ] Test SOC 2 compliance and audit requirements
- [ ] Validate API data retention and deletion policies
- [ ] Test API privacy controls and data anonymization
- [ ] Verify API audit logging and compliance reporting
- [ ] Check API international compliance requirements

### 4. API Security Monitoring & Response
- [ ] Test real-time API security event monitoring
- [ ] Verify automated threat response and mitigation
- [ ] Check API security incident detection and alerting
- [ ] Test API forensics and investigation capabilities
- [ ] Validate API security metrics and KPI tracking
- [ ] Test API security team notification and escalation
- [ ] Verify API security documentation and runbooks
- [ ] Check API security training and awareness programs

## Success Criteria
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in API endpoints
- 100% compliance with OWASP API Security Top 10
- <30 second threat detection and automated response
- Complete API security monitoring and alerting
- Full compliance with all applicable regulations (GDPR, PCI DSS)
- Successful prevention of common API attack vectors
