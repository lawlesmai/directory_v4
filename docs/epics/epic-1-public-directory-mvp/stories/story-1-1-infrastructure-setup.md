# Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure & Development Environment

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want to establish a Next.js foundation with the existing design system migrated so that we can build upon the sophisticated UI while leveraging modern React architecture.

**Assignee:** Frontend Developer Agent  
**Priority:** P0  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Sprint:** 1

## Epic Context
**Epic:** 1 - Public Directory MVP  
**Epic Mission:** Transform The Lawless Directory's sophisticated vanilla JavaScript prototype into a production-ready Next.js + Supabase application while preserving and enhancing all existing UI sophistication, performance optimizations, and user experience features.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Next.js Setup
- **Given** a clean development environment
- **When** initializing the Next.js 14 project
- **Then** the project should be configured with:
  - TypeScript support with strict mode enabled
  - App Router architecture (not Pages Router)
  - Tailwind CSS integration for utility classes
  - Custom CSS support for glassmorphism effects
  - ESLint and Prettier with project-specific rules

### Design System Migration
- **Given** the existing 880-line CSS file with 80+ custom properties
- **When** migrating to Next.js architecture
- **Then** the system should preserve:
  - All CSS custom properties as Tailwind theme extensions
  - Complete color palette (9 primary colors + extended variants)
  - Typography system (Poppins + Inter font loading)
  - Gradient definitions for premium and trust indicators
  - Responsive breakpoint system (320px, 480px, 768px, 1200px)
  - Glassmorphism backdrop-filter effects
  - Animation keyframes and transitions

### Development Environment
- **Given** the migrated design system
- **When** running the development server
- **Then** it should:
  - Start without errors or warnings
  - Support hot reload for CSS and component changes
  - Display a basic landing page with design system applied
  - Pass TypeScript compilation checks
  - Meet accessibility standards (axe-core validation)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Implement Tailwind CSS for utility-first approach
- Maintain CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- Set up proper font optimization with next/font

### File Structure
```
app/
  globals.css (design system variables)
  layout.tsx (root layout with fonts)
  page.tsx (homepage)
components/
  ui/ (reusable UI components)
styles/
  components/ (component-specific styles)
```

### Font Loading Strategy
- Preload Poppins (weights: 400, 500, 600, 700)
- Preload Inter (weights: 400, 500, 600)
- Implement font-display: swap for performance

## Current State Context
**Existing Prototype Assets:**
- 234-line semantic HTML structure with accessibility features
- 880-line CSS system with glassmorphism design and 80+ custom properties
- 861-line JavaScript with 3 main classes: LawlessDirectory, ParallaxManager, PerformanceMonitor
- Advanced features: search suggestions, mobile gestures, premium highlighting, modal system

**Performance Benchmarks to Maintain:**
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Lighthouse Performance Score > 90
- Mobile responsiveness across 4 breakpoints
- Touch gesture support with haptic feedback

## Dependencies
- None (foundation story)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- CSS custom property inheritance tests
- Responsive breakpoint validation
- Font loading verification

### Integration Tests
- Design system component rendering
- Theme switching functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### End-to-End Tests
- Page load performance validation
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Mobile viewport testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Next.js 14 project successfully initialized with TypeScript
- [ ] All 80+ CSS custom properties migrated and functional
- [ ] Font loading optimized with next/font
- [ ] Responsive design system working across all breakpoints
- [ ] Development server runs without errors
- [ ] Basic homepage displays with full design system applied
- [ ] Code passes linting and type checking
- [ ] All tests passing with >80% coverage

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Standard Next.js setup
- **Medium Risk:** CSS migration complexity due to glassmorphism effects
- **Mitigation:** Incremental migration with visual regression testing

## Backend/Frontend/Testing Integration

### Backend Requirements
- Environment configuration for Next.js
- Database connection preparation for future Supabase integration
- API route structure planning

### Frontend Implementation
- Component library foundation
- Design system token implementation
- TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- Responsive design system implementation

### Testing Strategy (TDD Approach)
- Test-driven development for design system components
- Visual regression testing for CSS migration
- Performance testing for font loading optimization
- Accessibility testing with automated tools

## Success Metrics
- **Technical:** Next.js development server starts without errors
- **Performance:** Design system loads with no performance regression
- **Quality:** 80%+ test coverage for foundation components
- **User Experience:** All existing prototype features preserved in new architecture
