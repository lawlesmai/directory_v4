1. Overall UX Goals & Principles


Target User Personas

End-User (Visitor): Values speed, accuracy, and a clean, trustworthy interface.
Business Owner: Values simplicity, clear ROI, and empowering tools.
Platform Administrator: Values functional and efficient management tools.

Usability Goals

A visitor can go from the landing page to making a phone call or getting directions to a business with minimal scrolling and no confusion.
A subscribed business owner should be able to log in and update their core business details in under 2 minutes.
The interface should be intuitive enough for infrequent users to return without needing to re-learn the system.

Design Principles

Visitor Experience is Paramount: When a design choice creates a conflict between user needs, the End-User (Visitor) experience will be prioritized.
Balance Modernism with Trust: The design must balance a modern, "edgy" aesthetic with clear, conventional usability patterns. Visual flair will be applied to branding and imagery, not to core functional components (buttons, forms, navigation), which must remain intuitive.
Encourage Exploration: The design should be engaging and invite users to dig deeper into the content.
Empower the Business Owner: The admin tools should feel simple, powerful, and give the business owner a sense of control.

2. Information Architecture (IA)


User Flow Diagram


Code snippet


flowchart TD
    A("Main Page") --> n2("Business Sales")
    A --> B("Business Page")
    A --> n6("Admin Dashboard")
    A --> n3("Business Dashboard")

    B --> D("Exploded Map") & n1("Feedback")

    n2 --> n4("Signup Page")
    n4 --> n5("Payment Page")
    n5 --> n3

    B -- "Claim Business" --> n2

    n6 --> n7("Subscription Management") & n8("Settings") & n9("Support")


Note on 'Exploded Map' feature: A full-screen map view centered on a selected business, showing other nearby businesses for context. The view must allow the user to plot their own position via address entry or geolocation.

3. User Flows & Interaction Requirements

(Detailed sequence diagrams for "Business Owner Onboarding" and "Visitor Search & Discovery" are documented for the development team.)
Key Interaction Requirements:
Sharing: A native "Share" feature must be available on the Directory Landing Page, Business Detail Page, and the Exploded Map view.
Actionable Contact Info: Email addresses must be mailto: links. On mobile, phone numbers must be tel: links.

4. Wireframes & Mockups

Primary Design Tool: Figma
Link: [A link to the final Figma project will be placed here]
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Detailed text-based wireframes for the "Directory Landing Page" and "Business Detail Page" are documented for implementation.

5. Component Library / Design System

Strategy: The project will use a headless UI library (Headless UI) in conjunction with Tailwind CSS.
Initial Inventory: Button, Card, Search Input, Filter Dropdown, Navigation, Map, Photo Gallery, Tag, Form Inputs, Modal.

6. Branding & Style Guide

Visual Identity: Based on the user-provided logo concept with the slogan "Find it here. Not everywhere."
Color Palette: A specific 10-color palette (ranging from dark blue and teal to warm gold and burgundy) has been approved.
Typography: Headings: Poppins, Body Text: Inter.
Iconography: Heroicons.

7. Animation & Micro-interactions

Motion Principles: Animations will be purposeful, smooth, and performant.
Key Effects:
Subtle, slow-moving gradient background animation.
Smooth page scrolling.
On-scroll reveal animations for cards.
"Glassmorphism" effect for key components like headers and cards.

8. Accessibility & Responsiveness

Accessibility Standard: WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
Responsiveness: A standard four-breakpoint system (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, Wide) will be used, collapsing to a single column on mobile.

9. Performance Considerations

Goal: Achieve a Google Lighthouse performance score of 90+ on mobile.
Strategies: Image optimization, lazy loading, and code splitting will be prioritized.
