## Technical Implementation

### A/B Testing Framework Architecture

#### Frontend Testing Components
```typescript
// A/B Testing Provider
export const ABTestProvider: React.FC<{
  children: ReactNode
  userId?: string
}> = ({ children, userId }) => {
  const [experiments, setExperiments] = useState<ExperimentConfig[]>([])
  const [userVariants, setUserVariants] = useState<Map<string, string>>(new Map())

  useEffect(() => {
    // Load active experiments and user assignments
    loadExperiments().then(setExperiments)
    if (userId) {
      loadUserVariants(userId).then(setUserVariants)
    }
  }, [userId])

  return (
    <ABTestContext.Provider value={{ experiments, userVariants }}>
      {children}
    </ABTestContext.Provider>
  )
}

// A/B Testing Hook
export const useABTest = (experimentId: string) => {
  const context = useContext(ABTestContext)
  const variant = context.userVariants.get(experimentId) || 'control'
  
  const trackEvent = useCallback((event: string, properties?: Record<string, any>) => {
    analytics.track(event, {
      ...properties,
      experiment_id: experimentId,
      variant: variant,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  }, [experimentId, variant])

  return { variant, trackEvent }
}
```

#### Conversion Tracking System
```typescript
// Conversion Event Tracking
export const ConversionTracker = {
  // Track funnel progression
  trackFunnelStep: (step: FunnelStep, properties: Record<string, any>) => {
    analytics.track('Funnel Step Completed', {
      step: step,
      funnel_stage: getFunnelStage(step),
      ...properties,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  },

  // Track conversion events
  trackConversion: (conversionType: ConversionType, value: number, properties: Record<string, any>) => {
    analytics.track('Conversion Completed', {
      conversion_type: conversionType,
      conversion_value: value,
      ...properties,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
    
    // Update conversion metrics
    updateConversionMetrics(conversionType, value)
  },

  // Track attribution
  trackAttribution: (touchpoint: Touchpoint, properties: Record<string, any>) => {
    analytics.track('Attribution Touchpoint', {
      touchpoint: touchpoint,
      attribution_model: 'first_touch', // or 'last_touch', 'multi_touch'
      ...properties,
