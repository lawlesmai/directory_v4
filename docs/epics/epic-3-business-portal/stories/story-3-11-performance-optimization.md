# Story 3.11: Business Portal Performance & Optimization

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Full-Featured Business Portal  
**Story ID:** 3.11  
**Priority:** P1 (Performance Critical)  
**Points:** 21  
**Sprint:** 4-5  
**Assignee:** Frontend Developer Agent

## User Story

**As a business owner using the portal regularly,** I want fast, responsive, and reliable performance, **so that** I can efficiently manage my business without technical frustrations or delays that impact my productivity.

## Background & Context

Business Portal Performance & Optimization ensures that all the sophisticated features and functionality delivered in Epic 3 maintain excellent performance standards. This story focuses on comprehensive optimization across frontend rendering, backend processing, database queries, and user experience.

The performance optimization must handle complex business data, real-time updates, large datasets, and concurrent users while maintaining sub-second response times and smooth interactions.

**When** implementing optimization strategies  
**Then** optimize resource consumption:

#### Bundle Size Optimization:
- JavaScript bundle size: < 300KB (gzipped) for main portal

### AC 3.11.3: Database & Backend Performance
**Given** complex business data and analytics  
**When** optimizing backend performance  
**Then** implement comprehensive optimizations:

```sql
-- Database optimization examples
-- Analytics query optimization with materialized views
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW business_analytics_summary AS
SELECT 
  business_id,
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,
  SUM(page_views) as daily_views,
  SUM(clicks) as daily_clicks,
  AVG(engagement_rate) as avg_engagement
FROM business_metrics
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY business_id, DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_analytics_summary_business_date 
ON business_analytics_summary(business_id, date DESC);

-- Optimized subscription access check
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_subscription_features(p_business_id UUID)
RETURNS JSONB
LANGUAGE plpgsql
STABLE
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  features JSONB;
BEGIN
  SELECT sp.features INTO features
  FROM businesses b
  JOIN subscriptions s ON b.id = s.business_id
  JOIN subscription_plans sp ON s.plan_id = sp.id
  WHERE b.id = p_business_id
  AND s.status = 'active';
  
  RETURN COALESCE(features, '{}');
END;
$$;

-- Efficient review aggregation
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_reviews_business_status_date 
ON business_reviews(business_id, status, created_at DESC)
WHERE status = 'published';
```

#### Caching Strategy Implementation:
```typescript
// Redis caching for frequently accessed data
const cacheConfig = {
  businessProfile: { ttl: 300, key: 'profile:' }, // 5 minutes
  analytics: { ttl: 120, key: 'analytics:' }, // 2 minutes
  subscriptionFeatures: { ttl: 600, key: 'features:' }, // 10 minutes
  reviewStats: { ttl: 180, key: 'reviews:' } // 3 minutes
}

export const getCachedBusinessData = async (businessId: string, dataType: string) => {
  const config = cacheConfig[dataType]
  const cacheKey = `${config.key}${businessId}`
  
  try {
    const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey)
    if (cached) {
      return JSON.parse(cached)
    }
    
    const freshData = await fetchBusinessData(businessId, dataType)
    await redis.setex(cacheKey, config.ttl, JSON.stringify(freshData))
    return freshData
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Cache error, falling back to direct fetch:', error)
    return await fetchBusinessData(businessId, dataType)
  }
}

// Client-side data fetching optimization
export const useOptimizedBusinessData = (businessId: string) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['business', businessId],
    queryFn: () => businessApi.getBusinessData(businessId),
    staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000, // 2 minutes
    cacheTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    retry: (failureCount, error) => {
      if (error.status === 404) return false
      return failureCount < 2
    }
  })
}
```

### AC 3.11.4: User Experience Performance
**Given** the importance of smooth user interactions  
**When** optimizing user experience performance  
**Then** ensure smooth interactions:

#### Animation & Interaction Performance:
- 60fps animations using CSS transforms and GPU acceleration
- Debounced input handling for search and filters (300ms delay)
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate user feedback
- Skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
- Virtual scrolling for large data lists (reviews, analytics)
- Intersection observers for efficient visibility detection

#### Error Handling & Resilience:
- Graceful degradation for failed API requests
- Retry logic for transient network errors (exponential backoff)
- Error boundaries to prevent complete application crashes
- Offline functionality for critical business operations
- Background sync for data updates when connection returns
- User-friendly error messages with actionable solutions

### AC 3.11.5: Performance Monitoring & Optimization
**Given** the need for continuous performance monitoring  
**When** implementing performance tracking  
**Then** create comprehensive monitoring:

```typescript
// Performance monitoring implementation
export const performanceMonitor = {
  // Core Web Vitals tracking
  trackWebVitals: () => {
    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {
      getCLS(metric => analytics.track('web_vital', { name: 'CLS', value: metric.value }))
      getFID(metric => analytics.track('web_vital', { name: 'FID', value: metric.value }))
      getFCP(metric => analytics.track('web_vital', { name: 'FCP', value: metric.value }))
      getLCP(metric => analytics.track('web_vital', { name: 'LCP', value: metric.value }))
      getTTFB(metric => analytics.track('web_vital', { name: 'TTFB', value: metric.value }))
    })
  },

  // API performance tracking
  trackApiCall: (endpoint: string, startTime: number, success: boolean) => {
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime
    analytics.track('api_performance', {
      endpoint,
      duration,
      success,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
    
    // Alert if API call is unusually slow
    if (duration > 3000) {
      console.warn(`Slow API call detected: ${endpoint} took ${duration}ms`)
    }
  },

  // Memory usage monitoring
  trackMemoryUsage: () => {
    if ('memory' in performance) {
      const memory = (performance as any).memory
      analytics.track('memory_usage', {
        usedJSHeapSize: memory.usedJSHeapSize,
        totalJSHeapSize: memory.totalJSHeapSize,
        jsHeapSizeLimit: memory.jsHeapSizeLimit,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      })
    }
  },

  // User interaction performance
  trackUserAction: (action: string, startTime: number) => {
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime
    analytics.track('user_action_performance', {
      action,
      duration,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  }
}

// Performance budget enforcement
const performanceBudgets = {
  maxBundleSize: 300 * 1024, // 300KB
  maxImageSize: 500 * 1024,  // 500KB
  maxApiResponseTime: 2000,  // 2 seconds
  maxRenderTime: 100,        // 100ms
  maxMemoryUsage: 50 * 1024 * 1024 // 50MB
}

export const enforcePerformanceBudget = (metric: string, value: number) => {
  const budget = performanceBudgets[metric]
  if (budget && value > budget) {
    console.error(`Performance budget exceeded for ${metric}: ${value} > ${budget}`)
    analytics.track('performance_budget_exceeded', { metric, value, budget })
    return false
  }
  return true
}
```
