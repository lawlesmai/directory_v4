## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Frontend Search Implementation

**Advanced Search Interface:**
- **Given** the need for comprehensive search functionality
- **When** implementing the search system  
- **Then** create the following features:

  **Full-Text Search:**
  - Real-time search suggestions as user types (300ms debounce)
  - Search across business names, descriptions, categories, and tags
  - Search result highlighting of matched terms
  - Fuzzy search for handling typos and variations using PostgreSQL trigram similarity
  - Search autocomplete with recent searches and popular queries
  - Keyboard navigation for search suggestions (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
  - Search analytics tracking for performance monitoring

  **Geographic Search:**
  - Search by city, state, or zip code with PostGIS integration
  - "Near me" functionality using HTML5 geolocation
  - Distance-based sorting and filtering with radius selection
  - Map integration for visual search results
  - Service area coverage validation

**Search Interface Component:**
```typescript
// Glassmorphism search with real-time suggestions
<SearchInterface
  placeholder="Search businesses, services, or locations..."
  onSearch={handleSearch}
  onFilterChange={handleFilterChange}
  suggestions={searchSuggestions}
  isLoading={searchLoading}
  className="max-w-2xl mx-auto"
/>
```

### Backend Search Optimization

**Database Query Optimization:**
- **Given** the business search requirements
- **When** implementing database queries
- **Then** ensure:
  
  **Full-Text Search Configuration:**
  ```sql
  -- Custom search configuration with unaccent support
  CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION custom_search (COPY = english);
  ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION custom_search
    ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword, asciihword, hword_asciipart, word, hword, hword_part
    WITH unaccent, english_stem;

  -- Search vector with proper indexing
  CREATE INDEX idx_businesses_search_vector ON businesses USING GIN(
    to_tsvector('custom_search', coalesce(name, '') || ' ' || coalesce(description, ''))
  );
  
  -- Trigram index for fuzzy matching
  CREATE INDEX idx_businesses_search_trigram ON businesses USING GIN(
    (coalesce(name, '') || ' ' || coalesce(description, '')) gin_trgm_ops
  );
  ```

  **Geographic Search Functions:**
  ```sql
  -- Distance-based search with service area support
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION search_businesses_nearby(
    user_location GEOGRAPHY,
    search_text TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
    radius_meters INTEGER DEFAULT 10000,
    category_filter UUID DEFAULT NULL,
    result_limit INTEGER DEFAULT 50
  )
  RETURNS TABLE(
    id UUID,
    name VARCHAR,
    description TEXT,
    distance_meters FLOAT,
    relevance_score FLOAT
  ) AS $$
  BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT 
      b.id,
      b.name,
      b.description,
      ST_Distance(b.location, user_location) as distance_meters,
      (ts_rank(b.search_vector, plainto_tsquery('custom_search', search_text)) * 0.6 +
       similarity(b.search_text, search_text) * 0.4) as relevance_score
    FROM businesses b
    WHERE 
      (search_text IS NULL OR 
       b.search_vector @@ plainto_tsquery('custom_search', search_text) OR
       b.search_text % search_text)
      AND (category_filter IS NULL OR b.primary_category_id = category_filter)
      AND ST_DWithin(b.location, user_location, radius_meters)
      AND b.status = 'active'
    ORDER BY relevance_score DESC, distance_meters ASC
    LIMIT result_limit;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
  ```

### Advanced Filter System

**Multi-Level Filtering:**
- **Given** the filtering requirements
- **When** building the filter interface
- **Then** implement:

  **Category & Filter Options:**
  - Multi-select category hierarchy with parent-child relationships
  - Rating-based filtering (4+ stars, 3+ stars, etc.) with review count weighting  
  - Premium business filtering with subscription tier badges
  - Business hours filtering ("open now", "open 24/7", "open weekends")
  - Price range filtering (if applicable to business categories)
  - Verified business filtering with trust signals
  - Distance radius slider (1 mile to 50+ miles)
  - Service area filtering for delivery/service businesses

  **Filter State Management:**
  - URL parameter synchronization for shareable filtered states
  - Filter combination logic with AND/OR operations
  - Active filter display with easy one-click removal
  - Filter count indicators and result preview
  - Mobile-optimized collapsible filter interface
  - Filter reset functionality with confirmation

### Search Performance & UX

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Given** the need for fast search responses
- **When** implementing search functionality
- **Then** optimize for:
  
  **Response Time Targets:**
  - Search suggestion response < 200ms
  - Full search results < 500ms  
  - Filter application < 100ms
  - Database query optimization with proper indexes
  - React Query caching for frequent searches
  - Debounced input to reduce API calls

**Search Result Display:**
- **Given** search and filter results
- **When** displaying results to users  
- **Then** provide:
  - Responsive business card grid with staggered animations
  - Sort options (relevance, distance, rating, name, newest)
  - Pagination with infinite scroll option
  - Result count and search performance metrics
  - "No results" state with suggested alternatives
  - Search term highlighting in results
  - Filter breadcrumbs showing active filters

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Search interface with glassmorphism design
export const SearchInterface: React.FC<SearchInterfaceProps> = ({
  onSearch,
  onFilterChange,
  suggestions,
  isLoading
}) => {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')
  const [showSuggestions, setShowSuggestions] = useState(false)
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false)
  
  const debouncedQuery = useDebounce(query, 300)
  
  const { data: searchSuggestions } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['search-suggestions', debouncedQuery],
    queryFn: () => fetchSearchSuggestions(debouncedQuery),
    enabled: debouncedQuery.length >= 2,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000
  })

  return (
    <GlassMorphism variant="medium" className="search-interface">
      {/* Search input with icon and loading states */}
      {/* Advanced filters panel */}
      {/* Search suggestions dropdown */}
    </GlassMorphism>
  )
}
```

### State Management Integration
```typescript
// Zustand store for search state
interface SearchState {
  searchQuery: string
  activeFilters: SearchFilters
  searchResults: Business[]
  searchLoading: boolean
  searchError: string | null
}

export const useSearchStore = create<SearchState>((set) => ({
  searchQuery: '',
  activeFilters: defaultFilters,
  searchResults: [],
  searchLoading: false,
  searchError: null,
  // Actions...
}))
```

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly filter interface with bottom sheet design
- Swipe gestures for filter category navigation
