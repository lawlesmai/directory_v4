## Performance Testing Implementation

### Load Testing Scripts
```javascript
// API Load Test Example
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '10m', target: 1000 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 0 },
  ],
};

export default function() {
  let response = http.get('https://api.directory.com/businesses');
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 200ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 200,
  });
  sleep(1);
}
```

### Frontend Performance Test
```typescript
// Component Performance Test
describe('Business Dashboard Performance', () => {
  it('should render within performance budget', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    render(<BusinessDashboard />);
    
    const endTime = performance.now();
    const renderTime = endTime - startTime;
    
    expect(renderTime).toBeLessThan(100); // 100ms budget
  });
});
```

### Database Performance Test
```sql
-- Query Performance Test
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM businesses 
WHERE location && ST_MakeEnvelope(-74, 40, -73, 41, 4326)
AND status = 'active'
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
