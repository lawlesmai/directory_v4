## Test Data Requirements
- Multiple business types (retail chains, restaurants, services)
- Various location configurations (urban, suburban, rural)
- Different franchise and corporate structures
- Multi-timezone and international locations
- Varying location sizes and staff counts
- Cross-location customer interaction scenarios

## Performance Metrics
- Location dashboard loading: <2000ms
- Cross-location data sync: <30 seconds
- Bulk operations processing: <5 seconds per 100 locations
- Geographic mapping display: <1500ms
- Multi-location search: <500ms
- Analytics aggregation: <3000ms for 100+ locations

## Security Considerations
- Location-specific access controls and permissions
- Secure data transmission between locations
- Role-based access for multi-location management
- Audit logging for cross-location operations
- Customer data privacy across locations
- Compliance monitoring and enforcement

## Tools & Frameworks
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Load testing tools for multi-location scenarios
- Geographic mapping testing frameworks
- Database synchronization testing tools

## Success Criteria
- 100% multi-location functionality operational
- <3 second response time for cross-location operations
- >99.9% data consistency across locations
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Full mobile responsiveness for location management
- Successful integration with mapping and geographic services
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance

## Risk Mitigation
