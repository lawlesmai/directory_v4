# Story 4.1: Admin Portal Foundation & Access Control

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Platform Admin Portal  
**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want a secure and comprehensive admin portal foundation with strict access control so that I can safely manage platform operations without compromising security.

**Assignee:** Backend Architect Agent  
**Priority:** P0  
**Story Points:** 25  
**Sprint:** 1

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Admin Authentication & Access Control

**Given** the critical nature of admin portal access  
**When** implementing admin authentication  
**Then** establish maximum security measures:

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Requirements:**
- Mandatory TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for all admin accounts
- SMS backup authentication for emergency access
- Hardware security key support (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Admin-specific MFA policies with shorter session timeouts
- MFA recovery procedures with Super Admin approval
- Failed MFA attempt monitoring and account lockout

**Access Control & Permissions:**
- Role-based access control with granular permissions
- IP address whitelisting for admin access (optional)
- VPN requirement for sensitive operations (configurable)
- Time-based access restrictions (business hours only)
- Concurrent session limits for admin accounts
- Automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity

### Admin Portal Security Infrastructure

**Given** the need for maximum security  
**When** building the admin infrastructure  
**Then** implement comprehensive security measures:

**Audit Logging & Monitoring:**
- Complete admin action logging with timestamps and details
- IP address and device tracking for all admin sessions
- Real-time security monitoring for suspicious activities
- Failed access attempt tracking and alerting
- Data access logging for compliance and auditing
- Admin action approval workflows for critical operations

**Database Access Control:**
```sql
-- Admin-specific RLS policies
admin_users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  admin_level VARCHAR(20) CHECK (admin_level IN ('super_admin', 'platform_admin', 'support_admin', 'content_moderator')),
  permissions JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  ip_whitelist INET[],
  mfa_secret VARCHAR(255),
  last_login TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  failed_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  account_locked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES admin_users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
)

admin_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  admin_id UUID REFERENCES admin_users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  session_token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  ip_address INET NOT NULL,
  user_agent TEXT,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
)

admin_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  admin_id UUID REFERENCES admin_users(id),
  action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  resource_type VARCHAR(50),
  resource_id UUID,
  old_values JSONB,
  new_values JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

### Admin Portal UI Foundation

**Given** the sophisticated design system from the main platform  
**When** creating the admin portal interface  
**Then** maintain design consistency with admin-specific enhancements:

**Design System Adaptation:**
- Dark theme optimized for extended admin usage
- Admin-specific color palette with warning and critical action colors
- Glassmorphism effects adapted for professional admin interface
- High contrast mode support for accessibility compliance
- Responsive design optimized for desktop admin workflows
- Mobile admin interface for emergency operations

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Security Architecture:**
- Zero-trust security model for all admin operations
- Encryption at rest for all admin-related data
- Secure session management with regular token rotation
- API rate limiting specific to admin operations

**Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient permission checking with caching
- Lazy loading of admin dashboard components
- Background processing for heavy admin operations
- Real-time updates for critical system metrics

**Compliance Requirements:**
- SOC 2 compliance preparation for audit logging
- GDPR compliance for admin access to user data
- Data retention policies for audit logs
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Dependencies

- Epic 2 Story 2.8 (RBAC system foundation)
- Epic 2 Story 2.2 (Server-side authentication infrastructure)

## Testing Requirements

**Security Tests:**
- Penetration testing for admin portal access
- MFA bypass attempt testing
- Session security and hijacking prevention tests
- Access control and permission escalation tests

**Audit & Compliance Tests:**
- Audit log completeness and accuracy validation
- Data access tracking and privacy compliance tests
- Admin action traceability and accountability tests
- Security monitoring and alerting effectiveness tests

**Performance Tests:**
- Admin portal load time and responsiveness tests
- Permission checking performance optimization
- Large dataset handling for admin operations
- Concurrent admin session performance tests

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Secure admin authentication with mandatory MFA
