## What is Multi-Factor Authentication?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring two or more verification methods:

1. **Something you know** (your password)
2. **Something you have** (your phone or authenticator app)
3. **Something you are** (biometric data - future feature)

Even if someone discovers your password, they still can't access your account without the second factor.

### MFA Methods Available

| Method | Security Level | Convenience | Recommended For |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Authenticator App (TOTP)** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Everyone (Primary choice) |
| **SMS Text Message** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Backup method |
| **Email Verification** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Secondary backup |
| **Backup Codes** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Emergency access |

## Why MFA is Important

### Protection Against Common Threats

- **Password Breaches**: Even if your password is compromised, MFA blocks unauthorized access
- **Phishing Attacks**: Stolen passwords alone can't access MFA-protected accounts
- **Account Takeovers**: Prevent criminals from accessing your business information
- **Identity Theft**: Protect personal and business data from unauthorized access

### Business Benefits

- **Customer Trust**: Show customers you take security seriously
- **Compliance**: Meet industry security standards and regulations
- **Reputation Protection**: Avoid costly data breaches and downtime
- **Peace of Mind**: Sleep better knowing your business is protected

### Real-World Examples

> **Case Study**: A business owner's password was stolen in a data breach. Because they had MFA enabled, the attackers couldn't access their Lawless Directory account or customer data. Without MFA, this could have been a devastating breach.

## MFA Requirements

### Automatic MFA Requirements

MFA is **automatically required** for:

‚úÖ **Business Owner Accounts**
- Verified business owners
- Premium subscription holders
- Accounts with customer data access

‚úÖ **Administrator Accounts**
- Platform administrators
- Moderators and support staff
- API key holders

‚úÖ **High-Risk Activities**
- Financial transactions
- Data export/deletion requests
- Security settings changes

### Grace Period for New Accounts

- **30-day grace period** for business owners to set up MFA
- **Gradual restrictions** as grace period expires
- **Full enforcement** after 30 days

### Voluntary MFA

**Recommended for everyone**, even if not required:
- Personal accounts
- Basic users
- Anyone handling sensitive information
- Users concerned about security
