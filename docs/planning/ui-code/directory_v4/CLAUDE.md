## Claude Agents
- **Using Agents**: Use claude agents by specialty in this directory when you can /Users/michaellawless/Documents/Vibe/Repo/Directory/.claude/agents
- **Multiple Agents**: You are able to use multiple agent concurrently.  This is encouraged.

## Testing
- *TDD* This is a testing first project where we will practice TDD. The every story for every epic should have a test plan prior to starting development.
- **Tools** Testing should use the Playwright and Jest MCP tools.
    - Testing should be logged as issues are identified, worked to resolution, and the process documented for each story in this directory: /Users/michaellawless/Documents/Vibe/Repo/directory_v3/docs/testing.
    - Each file should be named by the story name.
    - This process of testing at the end should be a loop that repeats until no issues are identified. There should be a max of 10 loops.

## Source Control
- **Rules** - Each story should be a new branch.
    - The agent should merge after each story is completed.
    - The branch names should be the Epic-StoryName.
    - Sync should take place after each commit and before merges.
    - The agent should use the github MCP for this process
