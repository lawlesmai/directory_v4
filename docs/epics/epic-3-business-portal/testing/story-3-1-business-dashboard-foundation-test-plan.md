# Story 3.1: Business Dashboard Foundation & Navigation - Test Plan

## Objective
Validate the core functionality, navigation, and user experience of the Business Dashboard for business owners.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Dashboard Access & Authentication
- [ ] Verify secure login for business accounts
- [ ] Test role-based access control
- [ ] Validate session management and timeout
- [ ] Test password reset and account recovery flows

### 2. Navigation Structure
- [ ] Verify main navigation menu items
  - Dashboard overview
  - Profile management
  - Analytics
  - Marketing tools
  - Subscription settings
- [ ] Test navigation between sections without page reload
- [ ] Validate responsive design across devices
- [ ] Check accessibility of navigation elements (WCAG compliance)

### 3. Dashboard Performance
- [ ] Measure initial dashboard load time (target <2s)
- [ ] Test real-time data updates
- [ ] Validate smooth interactions (60fps)
- [ ] Check memory usage and resource consumption

### 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Test dashboard behavior with slow/no network
- [ ] Validate error messages and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Check handling of large/complex data sets
- [ ] Test concurrent user sessions

## Test Data Requirements
- Multiple business account types (Free/Premium/Elite)
- Varied business sizes and industries
- Simulated high-traffic scenarios

## Performance Metrics
- Load Time: <2000ms
- Time to Interactive: <3000ms
- Frames Per Second: 60
- Error Rate: <0.1%

## Security Considerations
- JWT token validation
- HTTPS encryption
- Input sanitization
- Protection against XSS and CSRF

## Tools & Frameworks
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library
- Chrome DevTools Performance profiler

## Test Execution Strategy
1. Unit Testing: Individual component behaviors
2. Integration Testing: Dashboard section interactions
3. End-to-End Testing: Complete user journeys
4. Performance Testing: Detailed performance profiling
5. Security Testing: Penetration and vulnerability assessment

## Success Criteria
- 100% navigation functionality
- <50ms response time for section transitions
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Full accessibility compliance
- Consistent UI/UX across devices

## Potential Risks & Mitigations
- Complex navigation might confuse users
- Performance bottlenecks with large data sets
- Security vulnerabilities in authentication

## Notes
- Coordinate with UX team for visual consistency
- Involve business stakeholders for workflow validation
