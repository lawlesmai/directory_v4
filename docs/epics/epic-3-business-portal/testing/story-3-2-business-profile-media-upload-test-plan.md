# Story 3.2: Business Profile Management & Media Upload - Test Plan

## Objective
Validate comprehensive business profile management functionality, focusing on media upload, profile editing, and data integrity.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Profile Information Management
- [ ] Verify complete profile information editing
- [ ] Test validation rules for business details
- [ ] Validate unique business identifier generation
- [ ] Check cross-field validation and dependencies

### 2. Media Upload Functionality
- [ ] Test image upload for business logo
- [ ] Validate multiple image upload for gallery
- [ ] Check file type and size restrictions
- [ ] Test upload progress and cancellation
- [ ] Verify image compression and optimization
- [ ] Test maximum number of uploadable images

### 3. Media Processing & Storage
- [ ] Validate image format conversion
- [ ] Check cloud storage integration
- [ ] Test image metadata preservation
- [ ] Verify CDN caching and delivery
- [ ] Check image backup and redundancy

### 4. Performance & Responsiveness
- [ ] Measure media upload speed
- [ ] Test upload with varying file sizes
- [ ] Validate responsive design during upload
- [ ] Check memory usage during media processing

### 5. Security Considerations
- [ ] Validate file type sanitization
- [ ] Test upload authentication
- [ ] Check for potential XSS in file metadata
- [ ] Verify secure file storage
- [ ] Test file access permissions

## Test Data Requirements
- Various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Different file sizes (1KB - 10MB)
- Business profiles across different tiers
- Simulated high-concurrency upload scenarios

## Performance Metrics
- Upload Time: <3000ms for images <2MB
- Compression Ratio: 70-80%
- Supported Image Types: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- Max Concurrent Uploads: 5
- Storage Limit: 50MB per business

## Tools & Frameworks
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Jest for unit testing
- Sharp for image processing tests
- Cloudinary/S3 mock services

## Test Execution Strategy
1. Unit Testing: Individual upload components
2. Integration Testing: Profile management flows
3. End-to-End Testing: Complete profile creation
4. Performance Testing: Upload scenarios
5. Security Testing: File upload vulnerabilities

## Success Criteria
- Flawless media upload experience
- <100ms image processing time
- Zero data loss during upload
- Full WCAG accessibility
- Consistent UI across devices

## Potential Risks & Mitigations
- Large file upload failures
- Image processing bottlenecks
- Storage quota management

## Notes
- Coordinate with design team for UI consistency
- Involve backend team for storage integration
