# TDD Test Plan: Business Profile Contact Management

## Test Strategy Overview
Comprehensive testing for business profile contact management functionality, ensuring robust CRUD operations, validation, and secure data handling.

## Unit Tests (Jest)
### Contact Data Model Tests
- `should create a valid contact object with all required fields`
- `should reject contact creation with invalid email format`
- `should enforce phone number validation rules`
- `should handle optional contact fields gracefully`

### Contact Validation Tests
- `should validate contact data against business rules`
- `should prevent duplicate contact entries`
- `should sanitize input data before storage`

## Integration Tests
### Contact Management API Tests
- `should successfully create a new contact via API`
- `should update existing contact information`
- `should retrieve contact by ID`
- `should list all contacts for a business profile`
- `should delete a contact with proper authorization`

### Database Integration Tests
- `should persist contact data correctly in database`
- `should maintain data integrity during CRUD operations`
- `should handle concurrent contact modifications`

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
### Contact Management Workflow
- `should complete full contact creation flow`
- `should validate contact form inputs client-side`
- `should handle contact edit scenarios`
- `should demonstrate proper error handling for invalid submissions`

## Performance Tests
### Contact Management Performance
- `should handle batch contact operations under 200ms`
- `should maintain response time < 100ms for single contact operations`
- `should support concurrent user contact management`

## Security Tests
### Access Control
- `should prevent unauthorized contact data access`
- `should enforce role-based contact management permissions`
- `should log all contact management actions`
- `should sanitize and validate all contact input data`

## Accessibility Tests
- `should ensure contact management forms are WCAG 2.1 AA compliant`
- `should support keyboard navigation in contact management interfaces`

## Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility
- `should function consistently across major browsers`
- `should provide responsive design for mobile contact management`

## Edge Cases
- `should handle international phone number formats`
- `should manage contact data with special characters`
- `should implement proper error recovery mechanisms`

## Compliance Tests
- `should adhere to data protection regulations for contact storage`
- `should implement secure data transmission protocols`
