## Story 2.1: Supabase Auth Configuration & Security Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want to establish secure Supabase authentication infrastructure with proper SSR configuration so that all user authentication follows security best practices.

**Assignee:** Backend Architect Agent  
**Priority:** P0  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Sprint:** 1

### Detailed Acceptance Criteria

**Supabase Auth Project Setup:**
- **Given** a production-ready authentication requirement
- **When** configuring Supabase authentication
- **Then** implement the following configuration:
  
  **Authentication Providers:**
  - Email/password authentication with secure password policies
  - Google OAuth integration for social login
  - Apple Sign-In for iOS users (future-proofing)
  - Magic link authentication for passwordless login
  - Phone/SMS authentication for enhanced security

  **Security Policies:**
  - Minimum password requirements: 8+ characters, special characters, numbers
  - Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
  - Password reset rate limiting (max 3 per hour)
  - Email verification required for new accounts
  - Session timeout configuration (7 days inactive)
  - IP-based rate limiting for authentication endpoints

**Database Schema for Authentication:**
- **Given** the need for user management
- **When** setting up authentication tables
- **Then** create the following schema extensions:

  **`auth.users` Extensions:**
  ```sql
  -- Custom user metadata
  user_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
  app_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
  
  -- Example user_metadata structure:
  {
    "display_name": "John Doe",
    "avatar_url": "https://...",
    "phone_verified": true,
    "marketing_consent": false
  }
  ```

  **`profiles` Table (Public User Data):**
  ```sql
  profiles (
    id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
    display_name VARCHAR(255),
    avatar_url VARCHAR(255),
    bio TEXT,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    website VARCHAR(255),
    social_links JSONB,
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    marketing_consent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
  )
  ```

  **`user_roles` Table (RBAC System):**
  ```sql
  user_roles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'business_owner', 'admin')),
    granted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    granted_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
  )
  ```

**Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:**
- **Given** the security requirements
- **When** implementing RLS policies
- **Then** create comprehensive access control:
  
  **Profile Access Policies:**
  - Users can read their own profiles
  - Users can update their own profiles
  - Public read access to basic profile information
  - Admin read/write access to all profiles

  **Business Ownership Policies:**
  - Business owners can manage only their claimed businesses
  - Admins have full access to all businesses
  - Public read access to approved business information

**Environment Configuration:**
- **Given** multiple deployment environments
- **When** configuring authentication
- **Then** set up proper environment variables:
  - Development, staging, and production Supabase projects
  - Proper CORS configuration for all environments
  - Secure secret management for API keys
  - JWT secret configuration and rotation procedures

### Technical Implementation Notes

**SSR Configuration Requirements:**

**Permission System Implementation:**
- **Given** the complex permission requirements
- **When** building the permission system
- **Then** implement granular permissions:
  
  **Database Schema for Permissions:**
  ```sql
  permissions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    resource VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- businesses, reviews, users, etc.
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,    -- create, read, update, delete, manage
    conditions JSONB,               -- Additional permission conditions
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
  )
  
  role_permissions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    permission_id UUID REFERENCES permissions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    granted BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    conditions JSONB,               -- Role-specific conditions
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
  )
  ```

**Dynamic Permission Checking:**
- **Given** the need for real-time permission validation
- **When** checking user permissions
- **Then** implement efficient checking mechanisms:
  
  **Permission Check Functions:**
  ```typescript
  // Core permission checking functions
  async function hasPermission(userId: string, permission: string, resource?: any): Promise<boolean>
  async function requirePermission(userId: string, permission: string, resource?: any): Promise<void>
  async function getUserPermissions(userId: string): Promise<Permission[]>
  async function checkResourceAccess(userId: string, resourceType: string, resourceId: string): Promise<boolean>
  ```

  **Business Logic Integration:**
  - Business ownership validation for profile management
  - Review ownership checking for edit/delete operations
  - Admin-only access to platform configuration
  - Multi-location business team member permissions

### Technical Implementation Notes

**Database-Level Security:**
- Row Level Security policies for all permission-based access

- Component-level permission guards for UI elements
- Hook-based permission checking for React components
- Server action permission validation

**Performance Optimization:**
- Permission result caching with Redis (if needed)
