- **Then** the project should be configured with:
  - TypeScript support with strict mode enabled
  - App Router architecture (not Pages Router)
  - Tailwind CSS integration for utility classes
  - Custom CSS support for glassmorphism effects
  - ESLint and Prettier with project-specific rules

**Design System Migration:**
- **Given** the existing 880-line CSS file with 80+ custom properties
- **When** migrating to Next.js architecture
- **Then** the system should preserve:
  - All CSS custom properties as Tailwind theme extensions
  - Complete color palette (9 primary colors + extended variants)
  - Typography system (Poppins + Inter font loading)
  - Gradient definitions for premium and trust indicators
  - Responsive breakpoint system (320px, 480px, 768px, 1200px)
  - Glassmorphism backdrop-filter effects
  - Animation keyframes and transitions

**Development Environment:**
