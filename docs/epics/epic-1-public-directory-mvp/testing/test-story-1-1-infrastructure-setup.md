# TDD Testing Specification: Infrastructure Setup

## 1. Test Strategy Overview
- **Approach**: Comprehensive infrastructure validation
- **Testing Types**: Unit, Integration, Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Primary Tools**: Jest, Playwright, Docker, Terraform

## 2. Unit Tests
### 2.1 Environment Configuration
- [ ] Test correct loading of environment variables
- [ ] Validate development, staging, and production configurations
- [ ] Ensure sensitive information is not exposed

### 2.2 Dependency Injection
- [ ] Test correct initialization of core services
- [ ] Validate dependency resolution and injection patterns

## 3. Integration Tests
### 3.1 NextJS Configuration
- [ ] Verify correct NextJS server-side rendering setup
- [ ] Test API route configurations
- [ ] Validate webpack and build configurations

### 3.2 Supabase Integration
- [ ] Test database connection establishment
- [ ] Validate connection pool and query performance
- [ ] Verify secure credential management

## 4. Infrastructure Tests
### 4.1 Docker Configuration
- [ ] Validate Dockerfile build process
- [ ] Test container startup and service initialization
- [ ] Verify multi-stage build optimization

### 4.2 Terraform Deployment
- [ ] Test infrastructure provisioning scripts
- [ ] Validate cloud resource configurations
- [ ] Verify security group and network settings

## 5. Performance Tests
### 5.1 Build Performance
- [ ] Measure initial build time
- [ ] Test incremental build performance
- [ ] Validate code splitting and lazy loading

### 5.2 Resource Allocation
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during startup
- [ ] Test CPU utilization during initial load
- [ ] Verify efficient resource management

## 6. Security Tests
### 6.1 Secrets Management
- [ ] Validate secure environment variable handling
- [ ] Test prevention of credential leakage
- [ ] Verify encryption of sensitive configurations

### 6.2 Infrastructure Scanning
- [ ] Run comprehensive security scans
- [ ] Test for potential vulnerabilities
- [ ] Validate compliance with security best practices

## 7. Accessibility & Compatibility
### 7.1 Development Environment
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Verify consistent setup across different OS
- [ ] Validate development tool integrations

## 8. Test Data & Fixtures
- Prepare mock configurations for different environments
- Create test scenarios simulating various infrastructure conditions

## 9. Acceptance Test Scenarios
### Given an infrastructure setup
- When the application initializes
- Then all services should start correctly
- And security configurations should be validated
- And performance metrics should meet predefined thresholds

## 10. Implementation Examples
```typescript
// Example Infrastructure Validation Test
describe('Infrastructure Setup', () => {
  test('Environment Variables are Correctly Loaded', () => {
    expect(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL).toBeDefined();
    expect(process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY).toBeDefined();
  });

  test('Database Connection Establishes Securely', async () => {
    const connection = await connectToSupabase();
    expect(connection).toBeTruthy();
    expect(connection.status).toBe('connected');
  });
});
```

## 11. Test Execution Strategy
- Run tests in isolated environments
- Use continuous integration for automated testing
- Implement robust error handling and logging

## 12. Monitoring & Observability
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Set up performance and error monitoring
- Create detailed test reports with metrics
