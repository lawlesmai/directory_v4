### Enterprise Billing System Architecture

#### Custom Billing Engine
```typescript
interface EnterpriseContract {
  id: string
  customer_id: string
  contract_type: 'annual' | 'multi_year' | 'custom'
  payment_terms: PaymentTerms
  pricing_model: PricingModel
  sla_requirements: SLARequirements
  billing_schedule: BillingSchedule
  custom_terms: Record<string, any>
}

interface PricingModel {
  base_price: number
  volume_discounts: VolumeDiscount[]
  usage_based_pricing: UsageBasedPricing
  custom_rates: CustomRate[]
}

export class EnterpriseBillingEngine {
  async calculateEnterpriseBill(
    contract: EnterpriseContract,
    usageData: UsageData,
    period: BillingPeriod
  ): Promise<EnterpriseBill> {
    
    // Calculate base subscription costs
    const baseAmount = this.calculateBaseAmount(contract, period)
    
    // Apply volume discounts
    const discountedAmount = this.applyVolumeDiscounts(
      baseAmount, 
      contract.pricing_model.volume_discounts,
      usageData.total_locations
    )
    
    // Calculate usage-based charges
    const usageCharges = this.calculateUsageCharges(
      contract.pricing_model.usage_based_pricing,
      usageData
    )
    
    // Apply custom rates for specific services
    const customCharges = this.calculateCustomCharges(
      contract.pricing_model.custom_rates,
      usageData
    )
    
    // Calculate taxes and fees
    const taxesAndFees = await this.calculateTaxesAndFees(
      discountedAmount + usageCharges + customCharges,
      contract.customer_id
    )
    
    return {
      contract_id: contract.id,
      period: period,
      base_amount: baseAmount,
      discounted_amount: discountedAmount,
      usage_charges: usageCharges,
      custom_charges: customCharges,
      taxes_and_fees: taxesAndFees,
      total_amount: discountedAmount + usageCharges + customCharges + taxesAndFees,
      payment_due_date: this.calculateDueDate(contract.payment_terms, period.end_date)
    }
  }

  private applyVolumeDiscounts(
    baseAmount: number, 
    discounts: VolumeDiscount[], 
    locationCount: number
  ): number {
    const applicableDiscount = discounts
      .filter(d => locationCount >= d.min_locations)
      .sort((a, b) => b.discount_percentage - a.discount_percentage)[0]
    
    if (!applicableDiscount) return baseAmount
    
    return baseAmount * (1 - applicableDiscount.discount_percentage / 100)
  }
}
```

#### Custom Invoice Generation
```typescript
export class EnterpriseInvoiceGenerator {
  async generateCustomInvoice(
    bill: EnterpriseBill,
    contract: EnterpriseContract,
    customization: InvoiceCustomization
  ): Promise<InvoiceDocument> {
    
    const invoiceData = {
      invoice_number: await this.generateInvoiceNumber(contract.customer_id),
      bill_to: await this.getBillingAddress(contract.customer_id),
      ship_to: customization.shipping_address,
      purchase_order: customization.purchase_order_number,
      contract_reference: contract.id,
      payment_terms: this.formatPaymentTerms(contract.payment_terms),
      line_items: await this.generateLineItems(bill, contract),
      tax_breakdown: bill.taxes_and_fees,
      total_amount: bill.total_amount,
      due_date: bill.payment_due_date,
      custom_fields: customization.custom_fields
    }
    
    // Generate PDF with custom branding
    const pdfBuffer = await this.generateBrandedPDF(invoiceData, customization.branding)
    
    // Store invoice for record keeping
    await this.storeInvoice(invoiceData, pdfBuffer)
    
    return {
      invoice_data: invoiceData,
      pdf_document: pdfBuffer,
      delivery_method: customization.delivery_method
    }
  }

  private async generateLineItems(
    bill: EnterpriseBill,
    contract: EnterpriseContract
  ): Promise<InvoiceLineItem[]> {
    const lineItems: InvoiceLineItem[] = []
    
    // Base subscription line item
    lineItems.push({
      description: `${contract.pricing_model.plan_name} - ${bill.period.start_date} to ${bill.period.end_date}`,
      quantity: 1,
      unit_price: bill.base_amount,
      total: bill.discounted_amount,
      discount_applied: bill.base_amount - bill.discounted_amount
    })
    
    // Usage-based line items
    if (bill.usage_charges > 0) {
      lineItems.push({
        description: 'Usage-based charges',
        quantity: bill.usage_data?.total_usage || 0,
        unit_price: contract.pricing_model.usage_based_pricing.rate,

      })
    }
    
    return lineItems
  }
}

      qualification_criteria: {
        location_count: leadData.estimated_locations,
        annual_revenue: leadData.company_revenue,
        decision_timeline: leadData.decision_timeline
      }
    })
    
    // Assign to enterprise sales team
    await this.assignToEnterpriseRep(lead.id)
    
    // Schedule qualification call
    await this.scheduleQualificationCall(lead.id)
    
    return lead
  }

  async generateCustomProposal(
    leadId: string, 
    requirements: EnterpriseRequirements
  ): Promise<CustomProposal> {
    const lead = await this.getLead(leadId)
    
    // Calculate custom pricing based on requirements
    const pricing = await this.calculateCustomPricing(requirements)
    
    // Generate proposal document
    const proposal = await this.proposalGenerator.create({
      lead_id: leadId,
      company_name: lead.company_name,
      requirements: requirements,
      pricing: pricing,
      implementation_timeline: this.calculateImplementationTimeline(requirements),
      sla_terms: this.generateSLATerms(requirements),
      custom_features: requirements.custom_features
    })
    
    return proposal
  }

  private async calculateCustomPricing(
    requirements: EnterpriseRequirements
  ): Promise<CustomPricing> {
    const basePricing = await this.getBasePricing(requirements.estimated_locations)
    
    // Apply volume discounts
    const volumeDiscount = this.calculateVolumeDiscount(requirements.estimated_locations)
    
    // Add custom feature costs
    const customFeatureCosts = await this.calculateCustomFeatureCosts(requirements.custom_features)
    
    // Calculate multi-year discounts
    const multiYearDiscount = requirements.contract_length > 12 ? 0.15 : 0
    
    return {
      base_annual_cost: basePricing.annual_cost,
      volume_discount: volumeDiscount,
      custom_feature_costs: customFeatureCosts,
      multi_year_discount: multiYearDiscount,
      total_annual_cost: this.calculateTotalCost(basePricing, volumeDiscount, customFeatureCosts, multiYearDiscount),
