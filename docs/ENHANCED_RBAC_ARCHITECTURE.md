# Enhanced RBAC System Architecture
**Epic 2 Story 2.8: Comprehensive Role-Based Access Control Implementation**

## Overview

The Enhanced RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system provides fine-grained, high-performance permission management for the Lawless Directory platform. This system builds upon the existing authentication infrastructure to deliver enterprise-grade authorization capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Database Schema

#### Core RBAC Tables
- **`roles`** - System and custom roles with hierarchy support
- **`permissions`** - System permissions with resource-action mapping
- **`enhanced_permissions`** - Granular permissions combining resources and actions
- **`permission_resources`** - Hierarchical resource structure
- **`permission_actions`** - Available actions for resources
- **`role_permissions`** - Role-permission assignments with scope
- **`user_roles`** - User-role assignments with expiration and scope
- **`role_hierarchy`** - Role inheritance relationships

#### Enhanced Features Tables
- **`role_templates`** - Pre-defined permission sets for common roles
- **`permission_dependencies`** - Permission requirements and conflicts
- **`business_permissions`** - Business-specific permission assignments
- **`permission_cache`** - High-performance permission caching
- **`permission_approvals`** - Administrative approval workflows

### 2. Permission Evaluation Engine

#### Core Functions
- **`evaluate_user_permissions()`** - Comprehensive permission evaluation with caching
- **`user_has_enhanced_permission()`** - Fast single permission check (< 10ms)
- **`evaluate_bulk_permissions()`** - Efficient batch permission evaluation
- **`assign_enhanced_role()`** - Role assignment with approval workflows
- **`assign_business_permission()`** - Business context permission management

#### Performance Features
- **Intelligent Caching**: Permission results cached for 1 hour with intelligent invalidation
- **Hierarchical Evaluation**: Role inheritance with permission cascading
- **Bulk Operations**: Optimized batch permission checking
- **Context Awareness**: Scoped permissions (global, business, custom)

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Role Management (`/api/rbac/roles`)
- `GET` - Retrieve roles with optional filtering and stats
- `POST` - Create new roles or assign roles to users
- `PUT` - Update existing roles
- `DELETE` - Remove roles (non-system only)

#### Permission Management (`/api/rbac/permissions`)
- `GET` - Get user permissions or evaluate specific permissions
- `POST` - Bulk permission evaluation
- `PUT` - Refresh permission cache

#### Business Permissions (`/api/rbac/business-permissions`)
- `GET` - Retrieve business-specific permissions
- `POST` - Assign business context permissions
- `PUT` - Update business permissions
- `DELETE` - Remove business permissions

#### Performance Monitoring (`/api/rbac/performance`)
- `GET` - RBAC system performance metrics
- Cache hit ratios, computation times, active sessions

### 4. Middleware and Utilities

#### RBAC Middleware
- **`createRBACMiddleware()`** - Automatic permission enforcement for API routes
- **`withRBAC()`** - HOC for protecting server actions
- **`checkUserPermission()`** - Server component permission checking

#### Client-side Tools
- **`ClientRBACChecker`** - Browser-based permission evaluation
- **React Hooks**: `usePermission`, `usePermissions`, `useUserPermissions`
- **Components**: `PermissionGuard`, `withPermission` HOC

## Key Features

### 1. Hierarchical Role System
- **Role Inheritance**: Child roles automatically inherit parent permissions
- **Permission Cascading**: Higher-level permissions grant lower-level access
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Role assignments based on verification status

### 2. Granular Permission Control
- **Resource-Action Matrix**: Fine-grained control over specific operations
- **Contextual Permissions**: Scoped access (global, business, category)
- **Conditional Grants**: Permission rules based on dynamic conditions
- **Permission Dependencies**: Automatic granting of prerequisite permissions

### 3. Business Context Authorization
- **Owner Permissions**: Automatic full access for business owners
- **Employee Roles**: Manager, employee, contractor permission levels
- **Territory Scoping**: Geographic or departmental access control
- **Relationship Management**: Complex business relationship permissions

### 4. Administrative Controls
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-step approval for sensitive role assignments
- **Emergency Override**: Break-glass access for critical situations
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all authorization events
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time RBAC system health metrics

## Performance Specifications

### Target Performance Goals ✅
- **Permission Check**: < 10ms (achieved through caching and optimized queries)
- **Role Assignment**: < 50ms (direct database operations)
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: > 95% (intelligent caching with TTL management)
- **Bulk Evaluation**: < 100ms for 50 permissions

### Caching Strategy
- **Permission Results**: 1-hour TTL with user-specific invalidation
- **Role Assignments**: Cache invalidation on role changes
- **Business Context**: Scoped cache keys for business-specific permissions
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time cache performance monitoring

## Security Features

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users receive minimum necessary permissions
- Explicit permission grants required
- Regular permission audits and cleanup

### 2. Separation of Duties
- No single user has complete system access
- Critical operations require multiple approvals
- Administrative actions logged and monitored

### 3. Audit and Compliance
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All permission checks and changes logged
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable log retention periods
- **Compliance Reports**: Automated reporting for security audits
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual permission patterns flagged

### 4. Attack Prevention
- **Privilege Escalation Protection**: Strict role assignment validation
- **Session Security**: Integration with session fingerprinting
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints protected against abuse
- **Input Validation**: All RBAC inputs sanitized and validated

## Integration Points

### 1. Authentication System
- Builds on existing Supabase Auth infrastructure
- Integrates with JWT custom claims for client-side permissions
- Works with MFA requirements and session management

### 2. Business Management
- Automatic owner permissions for business creators
- Employee permission management for business operations
- Integration with business verification workflows

### 3. User Management
- Profile-based permission scoping
- User preference integration for permission display
- Account status integration (suspended users lose permissions)

## Usage Examples

### Server-side Permission Checking
```typescript
import { checkUserPermission } from '@/lib/rbac/middleware'

// Check if user can manage a specific business
const canManage = await checkUserPermission(
  'businesses', 
  'manage', 
  { businessId: '123' }
)
```

### React Component Protection
```tsx
import { PermissionGuard } from '@/hooks/useRBAC'

<PermissionGuard resource="businesses" action="create">
  <CreateBusinessButton />
</PermissionGuard>
```

### API Route Protection
```typescript
import { createRBACMiddleware } from '@/lib/rbac/middleware'

const rbacMiddleware = createRBACMiddleware({
  resource: 'businesses',
  action: 'manage',
  businessOwnerOverride: true
})
```

## Maintenance and Operations

### 1. Performance Monitoring
- Real-time dashboard for RBAC performance metrics
- Automated alerts for slow permission checks
- Cache hit ratio monitoring and optimization
- Database query performance analysis

### 2. Audit and Compliance

- Role assignment tracking
- Compliance violation detection

### 3. System Maintenance

- Role hierarchy validation
- Dead permission cleanup

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Features

- **Temporal Permissions**: Time-based access control
- **Geographic Permissions**: Location-based access restrictions
- **API Rate Limiting**: Per-role API usage limits

### 2. Integration Expansions
- **Third-party Identity Providers**: Extended OAuth/SAML integration
- **Mobile App Permissions**: React Native permission synchronization
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time permission change notifications
- **Analytics Integration**: Permission usage in business intelligence

### 3. Scalability Improvements
