# Story 6.1: API Architecture & Authentication System

**Epic:** Epic 6 - Public API Platform  
**Story ID:** 6.1  
**Story Title:** API Architecture & Authentication System  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Assignee:** Backend Architect Agent  
**Story Points:** 25  
**Sprint:** 1

## User Story

**As a** third-party developer  
**I want** a secure and well-architected API with robust authentication  
**So that** I can safely integrate business directory data into my applications

## Epic Context

This story establishes the foundational architecture for The Lawless Directory's public API platform, creating the core infrastructure that all other API functionality will depend on. This includes implementing RESTful API design patterns, comprehensive authentication mechanisms, and security measures that meet enterprise standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

### API Architecture Design

**Given** the need for scalable and maintainable API infrastructure  
**When** designing the API architecture  
**Then** implement a robust architectural foundation:

#### RESTful API Design
- ✅ RESTful endpoint structure following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- ✅ Consistent URL patterns and HTTP method usage
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes for all response scenarios
- ✅ JSON-based request and response formats
- ✅ API versioning strategy (v1, v2) with backward compatibility
- ✅ Content negotiation for different response formats
- ✅ HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) implementation

#### API Gateway & Infrastructure
- ✅ API gateway for request routing and management
- ✅ Load balancing across multiple API server instances
- ✅ Request/response logging and monitoring
- ✅ Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- ✅ CDN integration for global API performance
- ✅ Health check endpoints for monitoring
- ✅ Graceful error handling and degradation

### Authentication & Authorization System

**Given** secure API access requirements  
**When** implementing API authentication  
**Then** create comprehensive auth system:

#### API Key Management
- ✅ API key generation with cryptographically secure tokens
- ✅ API key rotation and lifecycle management
- ✅ Key-based rate limiting and usage tracking
- ✅ API key scoping for different permission levels
- ✅ Sandbox vs. production key environments
- ✅ Key revocation and emergency disabling
- ✅ API key usage analytics and reporting

#### OAuth 2.0 Implementation
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow for user data access
- ✅ Client credential flow for server-to-server authentication
- ✅ Refresh token management and rotation
- ✅ Scope-based permission system for fine-grained access
- ✅ JWT token implementation with proper claims
- ✅ Token introspection and validation endpoints
- ✅ PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for mobile apps

### API Security & Compliance

**Given** API security and privacy requirements  
**When** implementing security measures  
**Then** ensure comprehensive protection:

#### Security Measures
- ✅ TLS 1.3 encryption for all API communications
- ✅ Request signing for high-security operations
- ✅ IP whitelisting for enterprise API access
- ✅ DDoS protection and rate limiting
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- ✅ SQL injection and XSS prevention measures
- ✅ API security headers (CORS, CSP, etc.)

#### Privacy & Compliance
- ✅ GDPR compliance for user data access
- ✅ Data minimization in API responses
- ✅ User consent validation for data access
- ✅ Audit logging for all API access and operations
- ✅ Right to be forgotten implementation for API data
- ✅ Cross-border data transfer compliance
- ✅ Privacy policy integration for API usage

## Technical Implementation

### API Framework
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js or Fastify for high performance
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger specification for documentation
- **Generation:** Automated API documentation generation

### Authentication Infrastructure
- **JWT:** JWT implementation with proper key management
- **Storage:** Redis for session and token storage
- **OAuth:** OAuth 2.0 server implementation (node-oauth2-server)
- **Encryption:** API key storage with encryption at rest

### Performance & Scalability
- **Pooling:** Connection pooling for database access
- **Caching:** Response caching with Redis
- **Jobs:** Background job processing for heavy operations
- **Scaling:** Horizontal scaling with load balancer support

## Dependencies

- ✅ Epic 2 Story 2.8: RBAC system for API permissions
- ✅ Epic 1 Story 1.5: Database infrastructure for API data

## Testing Requirements

### API Architecture Tests
- [ ] RESTful API endpoint functionality validation
- [ ] Authentication flow testing (API key and OAuth)
- [ ] Authorization and permission validation tests
- [ ] API versioning and backward compatibility tests

### Security Tests
- [ ] API security vulnerability testing
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempt validation
- [ ] Rate limiting and DDoS protection tests
- [ ] Input validation and injection prevention tests

### Performance Tests
- [ ] API response time optimization (target <200ms)
- [ ] High-concurrency API request handling
- [ ] Database query performance optimization
- [ ] Caching effectiveness and invalidation testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] RESTful API architecture implemented with OpenAPI specification
- [ ] Comprehensive authentication system (API key and OAuth 2.0)
- [ ] API security measures and compliance implemented
- [ ] API gateway and infrastructure operational
- [ ] Performance optimization achieving <200ms response times
- [ ] API versioning and backward compatibility strategy
- [ ] Security testing passed with zero critical vulnerabilities

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:** Complex authentication system may introduce security vulnerabilities  
**Medium Risk:** API performance under high load  
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive security testing and load testing with performance optimization

## Success Metrics

- API response time 95th percentile < 200ms
- Authentication success rate > 99.9%
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- API uptime > 99.9%
- Developer authentication setup time < 5 minutes
