## Test Types

### Performance Benchmark Tests
```javascript
describe('Application Performance', () => {
  test('Achieves optimal initial load performance', async () => {
    const performanceMetrics = await measureInitialLoadPerformance();
    expect(performanceMetrics.timeToInteractive).toBeLessThan(3000);
    expect(performanceMetrics.firstContentfulPaint).toBeLessThan(2000);
  });

  test('Maintains consistent runtime performance', async () => {
    const runtimePerformance = await simulateComplexUserJourney();
    expect(runtimePerformance.averageFPS).toBeGreaterThan(55);
    expect(runtimePerformance.memoryConsumption).toBeLessThan(150);
  });
});
```

### Analytics Integration Tests
```javascript
describe('Analytics Tracking', () => {
  test('Captures critical user interaction events accurately', async () => {
    const analyticsTest = await validateAnalyticsTracking();
    expect(analyticsTest.eventCoverage).toBeGreaterThan(0.95);
    expect(analyticsTest.trackingOverhead).toBeLessThan(50);
  });
});
```
