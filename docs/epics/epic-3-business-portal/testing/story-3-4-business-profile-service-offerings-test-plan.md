# TDD Test Plan: Business Profile Service Offerings

## Test Strategy Overview
Comprehensive testing for business service offerings management, focusing on data integrity, performance, and user experience.

## Unit Tests (Jest)
### Service Offering Data Model Tests
- `should create a valid service offering object`
- `should enforce required fields for service offerings`
- `should validate pricing and availability constraints`
- `should handle complex service metadata`

### Service Validation Tests
- `should validate service offering against business rules`
- `should prevent duplicate service entries`
- `should sanitize service description inputs`

## Integration Tests
### Service Management API Tests
- `should successfully create a new service offering`
- `should update existing service details`
- `should retrieve service by ID`
- `should list all services for a business profile`
- `should delete a service with proper authorization`

### Database Integration Tests
- `should persist service offering data correctly`
- `should maintain data integrity during service modifications`
- `should handle concurrent service updates`

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
### Service Offering Workflow
- `should complete full service creation flow`
- `should validate service form inputs client-side`
- `should handle service edit scenarios`
- `should demonstrate proper error handling`

## Performance Tests
### Service Management Performance
- `should handle batch service operations under 250ms`
- `should maintain response time < 150ms for single service operations`
- `should support concurrent service management`

## Security Tests
### Access Control
- `should prevent unauthorized service data access`
- `should enforce role-based service management permissions`
- `should log all service offering actions`
- `should sanitize and validate all service input data`

## Accessibility Tests
- `should ensure service management forms are WCAG 2.1 AA compliant`
- `should support keyboard navigation in service interfaces`

## Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility
- `should function consistently across major browsers`
- `should provide responsive design for mobile service management`

## Edge Cases
- `should handle complex service pricing models`
- `should manage services with multi-language descriptions`
- `should implement proper error recovery mechanisms`

## Compliance Tests
- `should adhere to pricing and service description regulations`
- `should implement secure data transmission protocols`
