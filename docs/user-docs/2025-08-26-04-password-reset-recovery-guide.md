## Creating Strong Passwords

### Password Requirements

**Minimum Technical Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ 8-128 characters in length
- ‚úÖ Contains uppercase letters (A-Z)
- ‚úÖ Contains lowercase letters (a-z)
- ‚úÖ Contains numbers (0-9)
- ‚úÖ Contains special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};':,.<>?)

### Strong Password Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Passphrase Method (Recommended)
**Concept**: Use multiple random words with numbers and symbols

**Examples:**
- `Coffee!Morning$Sunrise2025`
- `Pizza#Bicycle*Mountain7th`
- `Garden@Thunder%Ocean15`

**Benefits:**
- Easy to remember
- Hard for computers to guess
- Meets all complexity requirements
- Naturally long and secure

#### Strategy 2: Password Manager Generated
**Concept**: Let password manager create and store complex password

**Examples:**
- `Kf8!nP2#mR7$vQ9@wE5%`
- `X3@kL9$fH6#pM2!nB8%`

**Benefits:**
- Maximum security
- Unique for every account
- No need to remember
- Automatically filled

#### Strategy 3: Personal System
**Concept**: Create a personal algorithm for generating passwords

**Example System:**
- Base phrase: "My dog's name is Max"
- Transform: "MyDog'sNameIsMax"
- Add site: "MyDog'sNameIsMaxLD" (for Lawless Directory)
- Add numbers: "MyDog'sNameIsMaxLD2025"
- Add symbols: "MyDog'sNameIsMaxLD2025!"

### What Makes Passwords Weak

**‚ùå Avoid These Common Mistakes:**

**Dictionary Words**
- password, admin, user, welcome
- football, baseball, basketball
- summer, winter, spring, fall

**Personal Information**
- Your name, family names, pet names
- Birthday, anniversary, graduation year
- Phone number, address, SSN digits
- Company name, job title

**Predictable Patterns**
- 123456789, abcdefgh, qwerty
- password1, password123, admin2025
- Sequential numbers: 11111, 22222

**Simple Substitutions**
- p@ssw0rd (password with @ and 0)
- adm1n (admin with 1)
- These are easily cracked by modern tools

### Password Security Best Practices

**‚úÖ Do This:**
- Use unique passwords for every account
- Use a reputable password manager
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Regularly review and update passwords
- Use long passphrases when possible

**‚ùå Never Do This:**
- Reuse passwords across multiple sites
- Share passwords with others
- Write passwords on sticky notes
- Use personal information in passwords
- Store passwords in unsecured files

## After Password Reset

### Immediate Steps

1. **Log In Successfully**
   - Test your new password immediately
   - Ensure login process works completely
   - Verify MFA still functions if enabled

2. **Update Saved Passwords**

3. **Review Account Security**
   - Check recent activity log
   - Review login history
   - Look for any suspicious activity
